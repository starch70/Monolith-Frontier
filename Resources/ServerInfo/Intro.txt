Welcome to Space Station 14! You have just started your shift in the Colossus Sector and along with your shipmates (or by yourself) should cooperate, make a living to the best of your ability and have fun (not at the expense of others hopefully).

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in person or over radio or via discord. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.

To reiterate, you are an independent civilian and you should not be harming each other unless you have an extremely good reason.


Instead of intents, we have combat mode. Check controls below for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
