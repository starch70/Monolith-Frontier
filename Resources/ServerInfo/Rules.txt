[color=#99ff99]Monolith Sector is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job as a station or ship crew member and delegating tasks that are outside of that description, or striking out upon space as a Captain of your ship. This does not imply you’re forced to play the whole round; Monolith Station is designed with pop-in-and-out gameplay in mind, where some players will come and go but their bank account remains persistent across server restarts.[/color]
