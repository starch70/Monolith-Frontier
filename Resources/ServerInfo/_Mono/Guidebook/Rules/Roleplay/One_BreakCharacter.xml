# Roleplay Rule 1
## Do not break character.

- You are portraying a character within the [color=yellow][italic]Monolith[/italic][/color] universe with realistic goals and desires, not yourself.
- Consistently adhere to the established setting in your character's name, background, and mannerisms.
- Ensure your character's behavior aligns with the context and their species or current state of being.
- [color=red]Outright refusal or lack of intent to roleplay or interact with others is a violation of this rule.[/color]

[italic][color=green]Stay in character and contribute to the immersive experience for everyone.[/color][/italic]
