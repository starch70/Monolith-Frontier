# Roleplay Rule 8
## Faction Role Rules

[color=Red][bold]You should not be abandoning your role in a faction without valid RP reason[/bold][/color].

[color=yellow][bold]As a faction member, you should assume that:[/bold][/color]
- Your character is a mentally stable individual. The TSF and USSP wouldn't enlist someone whos a psycho wanting to shoot up their teammates or civilians, and the Rogues wouldn't trust a psycho with a gun.
- Your character isn't part of any other groups that would take priority over your faction duties (such as religious groups, or acting under the orders of a company instead of your faction).
- You should listen to your superiors in most cases. This does not mean listen to your superiors when they order you to shoot a civilian without reason, and you should prioritize RP rules over this.

Various examples of [color=red][bold]Role Abandonment[/bold][/color] could be:

- As a Rogue, willingly working with TSF/USSP despite no circumstances that would require it (further highlighted in Conflict Rule One). This example is not exclusive to Rogues.
- Joining a faction only for its ships, gear, or access, and ignoring your duties to that faction (such as joining TSF/Rogues and going out to do Botany). Your actions should be for the benefit of your faction and cause, not yourself.

[color=yellow][bold]Admin Summary:[/bold][/color]
- Act mentally sound as a faction member.
- Do not act under orders/guidelines of other groups/companies as a faction member.
- Listen to your superiors when reasonable.
- Do not play factions just for gear/ships to play civilian.
- Do not willingly and knowingly assist members of another faction without a valid reason for alliance.
