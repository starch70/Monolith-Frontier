# Monolith Rules

## Foreword

Servers are often a diluted mess of rules and restrictions that hinder players' creative abilities and freedom to craft their own experiences.

We do expect, at the very least, that you [bold]stay in-character, adhere to the setting, and engage in quality roleplay to the best of your abilities[/bold].

This ensures your enjoyment and enhances the experience for the other players around you.

# Rule List

All of the below rules apply at all times, including between rounds, in-game, and elsewhere in our community.
