# Conflict Rule 4
## Outpost striking is not allowed.

Faction outposts (e.g., [color=yellow]Baikal Station[/color]) are [color=red][bold]not allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked until [color=yellow]admin permission[/color] has been given.
Mobile bases (e.g., [color=yellow]ASR Jupiter[/color]) do [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] fall under these rules.

[italic][color=yellow]This is designed to provide factions with a window to establish themselves and engage in roleplay before facing attacks.[/color][/italic]

- For clarity, a "strike" in this context refers to any (organized or unorganized) hostile action intended to damage outposts, seize control, eliminate its occupants, or damage docked ships.

See the [textlink="Safe Zones rule" link="MonolithRuleRoleplayEightSafeZones"] for areas that are always protected from strikes.

<!-- [italic][color=green]Respect the grace period to encourage fair play and allow for meaningful faction development.[/color][/italic] -->
