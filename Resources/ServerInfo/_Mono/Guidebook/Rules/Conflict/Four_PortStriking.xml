# Conflict Rule 4
## Outpost striking is not allowed.

Faction outposts (e.g., [color=red]Camelot Station[/color]) are [color=red][bold]not allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked until the [color=yellow]4 hour mark[/color] in the Round has been reached (can be checked with your PDA), or if [color=yellow]admin permission[/color] has been given.
- Mobile bases (e.g., [color=maroon]ASR Jupiter[/color]) do [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] fall under these rules.

[italic][color=green]This is designed to provide factions with a window to establish themselves and engage in roleplay before facing attacks.[/color][/italic]

- For clarity, a "strike" in this context refers to any (organized or unorganized) hostile action intended to damage outposts, seize control, eliminate its occupants, or damage docked ships.
- Action should be taken to avoid camping spawn areas (such as cryopods) if possible.

See the [textlink="Safe Zones rule" link="MonolithRuleRoleplayEightSafeZones"] for areas that are always protected from strikes.

<!-- [italic][color=green]Respect the grace period to encourage fair play and allow for meaningful faction development.[/color][/italic] -->
