# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch (RDM).

Players must have valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player.

- [color=red][bold]Random, unprovoked attacks or killings (RDM) are not allowed.[/bold][/color]
- [color=yellow]Non-lethal conflict[/color] and [color=green]roleplay escalation[/color] are strongly encouraged.
- Combat should arise naturally through roleplay, with proper escalation and meaningful interaction.
- [color=yellow]Non-lethal options[/color] (such as capturing, negotiating, or detaining) are strongly encouraged to foster deeper storylines.

[italic][color=yellow]Faction Conflict:[/color][/italic]
- The 3 major factions ([bold][color=#8B0000]Rogues/The Ashen Republic[/bold][/color], [bold][color=cyan]Trans-Solarian Federation (TSF)[/bold][/color], and [bold][color=brown]USSP[/bold][/color]), begin as hostile to eachother.
- Escalation is [bold]not required[/bold] for conflict between these 3 factions. This does not override safezone rules.
- Permanent, cooperative alliances between these 3 main factions are discouraged. You are not apart of the same faction or close allies and should not act like it.
- Truces, deals, non-aggression pacts, and other such diplomacy is allowed, as long as proper roleplay and justification is followed through. This includes diplomacy such as temporary alliances to deal with a greater threat or to squash a fellow rival, or subordinating or annexing other factions to your own faction, etc.

[italic][color=green]Conflict should be meaningful, and prioritize roleplay over random violence.[/color][/italic]
