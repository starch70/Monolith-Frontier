  # Ship Warfare

Warfare on the frontier is usually done via the means of [color=orange]ship gunnery[/color].

There are 3 types of ship weaponry available:
 - [color=gold]Ballistics[/color], which are weapons like autocannons, railguns, and all other unguided chemical-propellant weapons.
 - [color=MediumVioletRed]Energy[/color], which are weapons like plasma weaponry, lasers, and other similar non-chemical based weapons.
 - [color=GreenYellow]Missiles[/color], which are all guided munitions. It explains itself.

Ship weapons all need a [color=orange]gunnery control console[/color] and a [color=slateblue]gunnery control server[/color] to function. They will be abbreviated to [color=orange]GCC[/color] and [color=slateblue]GCS[/color] in most instances.

Ship weapons only fire if they are selected and if your cursor on the [color=orange]GCC[/color] is in the FOV of the turret.

Missiles will only track grids with a shuttle console, and are immediately pointed towards their tracked target upon detecting a target. Take into account the detection angle of your missiles, you can fire a lot farther than what the FOV of your turrets will allow if you do.

Most missiles have a tracking delay before attempting to seek out targets, and will not lock onto targets around 200 meters or less away from the origin ship, depending on the missile size.

## Shield Generators

Some ships are equipped with [color=cyan]shield generators[/color]. These absorb all incoming impacts, and add power draw for every projectile absorbed. [color=yellow]Note that shields only react to projectiles fired from ship weapons, not regular handheld weapons or tools.[/color] Shields will NOT block beam or hitscan weapons, such as [color=red][bold]lasers[/bold][/color], and the area effects of [color=teal][bold]EMPs[/color][/bold] or explosions will still go through.

  ## Bluespace Drives

  Many large, expedition, and combat ships are equipped with a [color=dodgerblue]Bluespace Drive[/color]. These can be fabricated with a T2 and T3 experimental research.

These increase the ship's FTL range by a certain amount if powered. For the [color=dodgerblue][bold]CTLA-25[/bold][/color], this range is [bold]5000m[/bold]

FTL speed is influenced based off the ship's mass. Heavier ships will have longer startup times, travel times, and longer cooldowns. More advanced drives can offset this effect.

Lighter ships have shorter startup times, travel times, and shorter cooldowns.
