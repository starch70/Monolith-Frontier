  # Chimeras and Letoferol

Chimeras are the result of a bioweapon chemical known as [bold][color=#a84387]Letoferol[/color][/bold].

There are 2 types of Letoferol:
 - There is [italic][color=#ebba34]natural Letoferol[/color][/italic], which is the pure form made in Chimeras. It is their bloodstream, and it is injected with their spike and melee attacks.
 - However, to get your infection in the first place, there is of course the base lab-grown [italic][color=#a84387]Letoferol[/color][/italic], which is a weaker kind, but still dangerous.

Natural Letoferol will spread biomass on tiles it's exposed to. This can make killing a Chimera a difficult task, as this biomass will spread and slowdown non-Chimeras on it.
 - To avoid the spread of biomass, options that don't involve bleeding are suggested (such as chemicals, acid or fire).

## Mesotaxinide and Mesophenerol

  There are 2 cures for a Chimera infection, the advanced [color=#437ca8][bold]Mesotaxinide[/bold][/color], and the much simpler, but less effective [color=#4ca832][bold]Mesophenerol[/bold][/color].
   - Mesotaxinide will do extreme damage on contact with Chimeras, so a spray or nozzle with the substance is the absolute best option for killing Chimeras.
   - To create Mesotaxinide, you can use [color=#a85832]protoletoferol[/color] from putting [color=#ebba34]natural Letoferol[/color] or normal [color=#a84387]Letoferol[/color] in a electrolysis machine.
   - Protoletoferol is mostly harmless, and its only use is for Mesotaxinide.

## Ruling, Goals, and Abilities

  As a Chimera, your goal is simply to infect as many as possible, at any cost.

  - To help you with this task, you can access a hivemind with the [bold]"+"[/bold] prefix before your chat messages.
  - Chimeras are also capable of complex interactions, including [bold][color=#40648f]surgery[/color][/bold], [bold][color=cyan]flying ships[/color][/bold], and even using [bold][color=orange]gunnery consoles[/color][/bold].
  - However, you will have severely reduced accuracy with ranged weapons even if you can hold and use them.
  - Your [color=yellow]bone spike[/color] ability will fire a spread of 7 letoferol-tipped bone spikes. It may not be enough to infect, but it'll still do decent damage to your opponents from the effects of Letoferol in a bloodstream.
  - Chimeras also have a few slots for storage, and have access to an internal 5x5 storage.

  [bold][color=red]Chimeras are still affected by [textlink="faction base rules" link="MonolithRuleConflictFourPortStriking"] and [textlink="safezone rules" link="MonolithRuleRoleplaySevenSafeZones"][/color][/bold]

## Organs

  Most of a Chimera's abilities are in its [color=yellow]organs[/color].

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganChimeraStomach"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OrganChimeraLiver"/>
  </Box>

  - The [color=cyan]heart[/color] will give you pressure immunity.
  - The [color=cyan]pheropod[/color] will give you space immunity, and access to the Chimera Hivemind.
  - The [color=cyan]stomach[/color] works as an advanced metabolizer, capable of metabolizing any chem, and metabolizing 5 at a time.
  - The [color=cyan]spike gland[/color] (obviously) lets you fire the same letoferol-tipped spikes as a Chimera.

  [italic]Chimeras also need these organs for their abilities! Take away a chimera's pheropod and spike gland, and it'll be just another boring monster![/italic]
